I created this project to learn a bit of Rust and to make my work easier. Later, I discovered something called Azure Update Manager. Well… It was still a lot of fun!




How to use:
- Create a servers.toml file.
- Place it in the same folder as server-manager.exe.
- Run server-manager.exe to start the application.
